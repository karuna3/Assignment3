## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r}
#1
freshman_kgs<-read.csv(file = "C:\\Users\\karun\\OneDrive\\Documents\\freshman_kgs.csv", sep = ",", header = TRUE)
hw_200<-read.csv(file = "C:\\Users\\karun\\OneDrive\\Documents\\hw_200.csv",sep = ",",header = TRUE)
```

```{r}
#2

#We can use either column number of column name
September_Weight<-freshman_kgs[,2]
September_Weight<-freshman_kgs[, colnames(freshman_kgs)[2]]

September_bmi<-freshman_kgs[, colnames(freshman_kgs)[4]]
September_bmi<-freshman_kgs[,4]
```

```{r}
#3
noofEntries<-0
totalWeight<-0
for(i in seq_along(September_Weight))
{
  totalWeight<-totalWeight+September_Weight[i]
  noofEntries<-noofEntries+1
}
meanWeight<-totalWeight/noofEntries
print(meanWeight)
```

```{r}
#4
noofEntries<-0
total<-0
func_mean<-function(value)
{
  noofEntries<<-noofEntries+1
  total<<-total+value
  
  return (total/noofEntries)
}

for(i in seq_along(September_Weight))
{
  print(func_mean(September_Weight[i]))
}
```

```{r}
#5
noofEntries<-0
total<-0
lapply(as.list(September_bmi), func_mean)
print(paste("Total is ",total," and number of entries is ",noofEntries))
print(paste("Average is ",total/noofEntries))
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
